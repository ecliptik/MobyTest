# MobyTest

Just playing around but planning a *kit system test in future

Followed the instructions in https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit to install the moby tool.

Copied the docker example and just updated to pull in official Jenkins Alpine image.

Commands : 

```
moby build JenkinsOS.yml
moby run JenkinsOS
```

Booted .iso and .vmdk from VirtualBox. Worked fine.

Will add more details later.
